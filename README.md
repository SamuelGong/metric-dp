# Metric Differential Privacy for NLP

Given a **Vocabulary** [Dictionary] and a lexical **Embedding** [Array], e.g., ```GloVe``` or ```BERT```, this repository provides a ```Class``` to perturb numeralized tokens. Approximate Nearest Neighbors are calculated using ```Annoy```. Calibration of Multivariate Perturbations are explained in ```Feyisetan et al. (2020)```.
